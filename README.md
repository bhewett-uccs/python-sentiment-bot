Python Sentiment Analysis Bot (Topics CS 3030 - Final Project)

Proposal Idea:
To create a basic sentiment analysis program that will parse messages and comments through social media, as well as possibly various cryptocurrency exchanges and maybe even news articles to gauge the overall "vibe" of the cryptocurrency or stock market regarding a specific product or group of products.

Movements in various markets involving securities (and especially cryptocurrencies) are heavily influenced by the underlying mood of the market participants trading and investing in those markets. For instance, if price is climbing rapidly there's a tendancy for the emotions of those in the market to be overwhelmingly positive, whereas if the price is dropping rapidly the underlying emotions will likely be overwhelmingly negative.

Armed with this information, a potential trader or invester can make better-informed decisions based on how they interpret the results of the overall market sentiment. Some people may want to enter a trade once the rest of the market is positive (or "bullish") whereas for others this will be interpreted as a sign to sell and exit the market.

Ultimately this information can be used by a human trader, or can be incorporated into an algorithmic trading program that can make impartial buy/sell decisions on behalf of a human user. We may or may not do this part, the ultimate objective is just to create a tool that will be able to give useful information at-a-glance so anyone using it can be more aware of market conditions at any given point in time.
